## Not actually Frequently Asked Questions

### My game is crashing on startup/freezing during world load, what do I do? (Or alternatively, how do I allocate the minimum 3 gigabytes of RAM?)

If you game crashes while launching and the crash log has a line like `Caused by: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded` or `Caused by: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`, it's because the game has run out of RAM. StoneBlock needs a minimum of 4 gigabytes—but ideally 6—to run.

Go to Twitch settings and make sure the amount of RAM is at least 3 or 4 gigabytes:
